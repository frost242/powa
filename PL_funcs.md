This is a list of all functions and what they are used for:

  * `powa_take_snapshot`: takes a snapshot. It means calling all the **snapshot** functions registered in the **powa_functions** table, then maybe do an **aggregate** and/or a **purge**, if conditions are met (these functions are also registered in powa_functions).
  * `powa_take_statements_snapshot`: takes a snapshot of pg_stat_statements. This is the included **snapshot** function.
  * `powa_statements_purge`: does a purge of collected data from pg_stat_statements. This is the included **purge** function.
  * `powa_statements_aggregate`: does an aggregate (putting individual records into arrays to save space) on collected data from pg_stat_statements. This is the included **aggregate** function.
  * `powa_getstatdata`: returns all the pg_stat_statements on all the queries on all databases for a given period. Should seldom be used in a GUI (or anywhere), at least in the period is large.
  * `powa_getstatdata_sample`: returns approximately the amount of samples asked from the collected pg_stat_statements of a query, for a given period. It will return at least (if available) as many samples as asked. The query is specified as its md5 from powa_statements.
  * `powa_getstatdata_sample_db`: same as powa_getstatdata_sample, but for a whole database. As there is no per database aggregation for now, this can be a bit costly. This may be improved in a future release.
  * `powa_getstatdata_db`: returns all the pg_stat_statements on all the queries on a database for a given period. Should seldom be used in a GUI (or anywhere), at least in the period is large.
  * `powa_stats_reset`: cleans-up pg_stat_staments collected data. **FIXME: Should be moved to dedicated functions, and stored in powa_functions**.

Some more functions based on pg_proctab were added to gather system statistics. Linux is the only supported system right now.
  * `pg_cputime`: outputs CPU time counters.
  * `pg_loadavg`: outputs load average counters.
  * `pg_memusage`: outputs memory usage counters.
  * `pg_diskusage`: outputs per storage device usage counters.
